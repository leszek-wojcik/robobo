If you would like to start your github hosted page I will briefly describe what I've
done. You can see my code in repository so I think this could be useful. 

Why would you even like to use github pages? 
I assume nowdays if you want to share your project you need a webpage.
Otherwise nobody will pay attention to your work unless you are Apple or
Google.  I think it is extremely useful to get webpage created out from your
repository so you keep everything in one place. This way your work is efficient
and streamlined. Github provides you an easy way to get your web page hosted.
Web page generated this way is static so don't expect any business logic at
server side - this is purely for presentation and nothing more.  

Few words about my process of webpage creation.  Please take a look into my
repository. I've selected to host ```docs``` folder. my process

Lets get started. 

Although it seems like github provide easy to use guide I fell into several
pitfalls. I'm not so into Ruby so technology is new to me.

First at all you *need* to do Jekyll compile at your side before starting any
work in your repository. This will basically reduce number of really
unnecessary commits. Secondly be advised that Jekyll compile of your pages are
not happening right away. It make take minutes until changes you push to your
repository are visible on your browser.
