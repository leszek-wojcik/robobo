By term Servo we usually refer to DC motor with additional electronics that is
used to control DC motor in such way that user is able to say what is requested
position of motor shaft. You can buy pre built servos but these servos usually
are targeted for particular use i.e. avionics etc. Goal of robotic arm is to be
universal. Servo settings will eventually vary depending on what job arm is
actually doing. Here you will learn about Encoder, H-Bridge and PID controller. 

# Circuit

Below you can see diagram that I used for building servo. Parts I've chosen for
my project are:
 - [Pololu 131:1 Metal Gearmotor 37Dx73L mm with 64 CPR Encoder](https://www.pololu.com/product/2827)
 - [Dual VNH3SP30 Motor Driver Carrier MD03A](https://www.pololu.com/product/707)
 - [Arduino Mega 2560](https://store.arduino.cc/usa/arduino-mega-2560-rev3)

Basic control of DC motor is simple. Basically if you add the voltage to the motor
terminals you will get your motor running. Depending on voltage motor will spin
faster or slower and direction of motor shaft movement depends on voltage sign.
Please take a note that this is far off what servo is. Direct control over
motor where only voltage is used to enable movement does not provide any
confidence on shaft position or even rotation speed. Ideally motor speed is
proportional to voltage provided but we cannot guarantee this proportion to be
fixed over time. Usually we add variable load to motor. Consider robotic arm
which is used to carry chess pieces. When arm carries king or queen load is
different when arm carries pioneer. If our control would relay only on voltage
value applied to motor then in these cases it would lead to different movements
for queen, king or pioneer. 

That is a reason why we need a feedback based control. Basically controller needs
to look up for current shaft position and adjust voltage accordingly. 

# How Arduino controller knows what is position of motor shaft ?

This is the moment where I need to describe Encoder. Encoder is an eye of
controller constantly looking over motor shaft position. On diagram you can see
purple and yellow wires coming out form encoder and hooked up to Arduino
board. Arduino can learn what is shaft position by looking on signals states on
these wires. Additionally encoder is connected to GND and +5V with green and
blue wire for power supply. I will cover encoder details in dedicated post.

# How Arduino controls motor ?

Assuming Arduino is able to precisely tell what is shaft position it also needs
to provide voltage and current that is able to move Motor shaft. Motors like
Pololu one can consume lot of power. Lets say: motors like that consumes more
power than Adruino board itself. To be precise: According to Pololu this
particular motor consumes 300 mA in free run and up to 5A in peaks. That is a
lot. This is direct reason we cannot hook up Adruino directly to motor. We need
to have additional power amplifier. Once again we use Pololu part - Motor
Driver. Motor Driver provides isolation of control signals from motor to
protect Arduino. 

Consider this. There are multiple scenarios were you would like to keep Arduino
isolated from motor. In cases where heavy load is attached to motor shaft and
motor shaft spins with maximum speed. Then you stop providing voltage to motor.
Obviously motor will keep rotating due to inertia. In this case motor will
behave like generator and will provide a voltage on its terminals. Such voltage
could harm your Arduino. 

In order to avoid negative impact of such scenarios Motor Drivers usually
integrates dedicated circuits to minimize side effects of such scenarios.  Most
common circuit used for that purpose is [H
Bridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H_bridge).

H Bridge control direction of motor movement. Two wires: yellow and orange -
are used to control movement direction. Additional green wire is for motor
voltage control. Pololu circuit is also connected to GND by black wire and to
+5V by blue wire.

# Control algorithm
At the moment this is just a teaser. There are multiplies strategies how to set
voltage control on motor terminals in order to get requested shaft position. If my
requested position is, lets say `44`, and current position is `11` I should apply
some voltage to motor in order to get shaft position changed to `44`.  But what
voltage should it be? Should it be max? 

In servos we often use PID algorithm as it brings good quality control. I will
describe control strategies in separate articles.

# Summary
I briefly described what servo is and problems we need to solve in order to
create it. I hope you are ready to go for further reading and finally lets do
some implementation.
