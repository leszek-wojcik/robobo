For every IT project it is essential to define milestones in its implementation
phases. Good milestones are useful for developers as well as business. From
engineering perspective it allows to verify engineering assumptions taken
throughout project. From business perspective it is a perfect opportunity to
exercise business case and adjust if needed. In agile/scrum software
development methodologies milestones are frequent by design. This article
provides summary for first Robobo milestone. 

# Good milestone definition

IT work definition should always focus on value added to product. When working
on a software it is actually very easy to loose sight for real value of an
application.  Its common issue for developers to loose sight of real value of
their work. I tend to see this a lot in my work. I've seen this more then
several times how people are easily falling into this trap.  Reason of this
happening is quite simple. Whenever you writing a code you are solving
technical problems closely related to software logic, algorithms, data
structuresr. Mostly you are solving a lot small logical issues. In short your
usual job is to focus on details.  Moreover It is also tempting to refactor
your code multiple times as you are seeking for perfect solution for given
problems. This kind of focus allows you to easy forget what you are trying to
achieve in first place.

Good milestone definition should recap real value of software increment as seen
from end user lenses. Should be simple enough that should be kept as motto
while doing development work.

Since Robobo is not a commercial product its hard to capture end user
perspective. But going back to motivations behind Robobo we can still provide
right perspective. *Robobo is educational and presention project. Robobo is to
provide entry level for... expand knowledge ..."* and so on. As we look into
education aspects we need to select milestones that captures small amount of
knowledge and experience gained while working on something that is presentable. 

# Milestone definition

**As a Product Owner I want to have working solution based on Robobo platform
that ties all knowledge presented so far, so that reader has ability to see
usefulness of knowledge.**


**As a Product Owner I want to have working solution presented so I gain
attraction for Robobo project.**

*Ladies and Gentlemen I present you capabilities of Robobo platform. I made a
Adrunio clock using DC motors*

# Setup
Following diagram represents two servo motors connected to Arduino Due board. 

![Diagram](https://leszek-wojcik.github.io/robobo/images/Clock.jpg)

For simplicity reasons LCD is not presented on diagram. Please refer to
equivalent robobo setup code:

```c
void Robobo::createClockSetup(void)
{
    // LCD and DISPLAY MANAGER
    const int rs = 2, en = 3, d4 = 4, d5 = 5, d6 = 6, d7 = 7;
    lcd = new LiquidCrystal(rs, en, d4, d5, d6, d7);
    disp = new DisplayManager("lcd_task\0", tskIDLE_PRIORITY, lcd, 1000 );

    // DC1 
    dc1 = new DCMotor(22, 23, 24, 25, 8, "dc1");
    pid1 = new PID("pid_task\0", tskHIGH_PRIORITY, 0.15,0.0000001,0,dc1);
    dc1->setControlStrategy(pid1);
    // Attaching interrupts for DC1
	attachInterrupt(digitalPinToInterrupt(22),encoderDc1_ISR, CHANGE);
	attachInterrupt(digitalPinToInterrupt(23),encoderDc1_ISR, CHANGE);
    attachInterrupt(digitalPinToInterrupt(26),limitSwitchDc1_ISR, FALLING);  

    // DC2 
    dc2 = new DCMotor(28, 29, 30, 31, 9, "dc2");
    pid2 = new PID("pid_task\0", tskHIGH_PRIORITY, 0.15,0.0000001,0,dc2);
    dc2->setControlStrategy(pid2);
    //// Attaching interrupts for DC2
	attachInterrupt(digitalPinToInterrupt(28),encoderDc2_ISR, CHANGE);
	attachInterrupt(digitalPinToInterrupt(29),encoderDc2_ISR, CHANGE);
    attachInterrupt(digitalPinToInterrupt(32),limitSwitchDc2_ISR, FALLING);  

    // CONTROLLER
    controller = new Controller(dc1,dc2,disp);
}
```

- We create [LiquidCrystal](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/LiquidCrystal)
  object. This object is taken as is from Arduino.
- Instance of `DisplayManager` is ActiveObject adapter for LiquidCrystal object. I will
  describe concept in separate article. This particular runs at low priority.
- For `dc1` and `dc2` DC motors we create PID active object with high priority.
  The concept here is basically same as described in [servo post](
https://leszek-wojcik.github.io/robobo/arduino/servo/encoder/pololu/hbridge/pid/2017/12/29/servo.html)
and [robobo software
design](https://leszek-wojcik.github.io/robobo/c++,/freertos,/activeobject/2018/03/09/robobo-design.html)
- We are adding limit switches interrupt routines.
- At the end new controller active object is created.

# Controller

Controller has following responsibilities:
- At initialization phase it holds off until all active objects are in steady
  state. This is done by `initTimer` which is defined as 3 seconds:
```c
initTimer = createOneTimeTimer(
        std::function<void()>(bind(&Controller::controllerFunc, this)),
        3000);
```
- When `controllerFunc` is executed controller sets low voltage for `dc1` and `dc2`. For both motors in order to make them move slowly towards limit switches direction:
```c
dc1->setDirectionRight();
dc1->setVoltage(30);
```
then runs a periodic check to see if motors did indeed stopped:
```c
calibrationTimer = createTimer(
        std::function<void()>(bind(&Controller::calibrationCheck, this)),
        3000);
```
- Motor stop condition is determined when checking flag of `DCMotor` which is
  done by method `isEmergencyStopped()` while the flag is set on interrupt
routines `limitSwitchDc1_ISR` and `limitSwitchDc2_ISR`.

- When both motors are emergency stopped main responsibility of controller
  cahnges to main one. Controller stops `calibrationTimer` and starts it once
again with period value of 1 second. 
```c
stopTimer(calibrationTimer);
calibrationTimer = createTimer(
        std::function<void()>(bind(&Controller::mainFunc, this)),
        1000);
```
- Now every second controller increases seconds counter and calculates
  requested motors position corresponding with minutes and seconds 
```
        void mainFunc()
        {

            seconds++;
            minutes = seconds/60;

            secondPos = -140 * seconds;
            minutesPos = -140 * minutes;
            a->setRequestedPosition(secondPos);
            b->setRequestedPosition(minutesPos);
            ...
        }
```
- Once requested position is set PID objects takes care of rest so controller
  job is finished until next period driven by `calibrationTimer`.
