ROBOBO is AVR Arduino project. Goal is to build robotic ARM. Arduino Mega is
used. Project aims to use latest tool chains available to make work efficient
and collaborative. Hope you can use my experience for your small and large
project. My goal is to share my knowledge and practices taken from my past work
experience.
